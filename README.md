## Inspiration
    Safety is something a lot of us take for granted. We realized that for a lot of people, just getting from one place to another can be dangerous. Some of these people rely on a simple phone call so a friend or family member can ensure their safety. But what if there's no one to call? 

## What it does
    Buddy Finder is a network that allows anyone to ensure the safety of these people. If there is no one to call, then Buddy Finder allows you to match with someone trustworthy for a simple chat as 


## How we built it
    We built the mobile application using Expo and React Native. We started with Figma for UI and design and then started working as a group with VSCode liveshare. After developing the main pages, we implemented Firebase authenticator and database to track accounts and store confidential information. We used a variety of APIs and React libraries to include various functionalities to our project, such as Google Maps and SMS messaging.

## Challenges we ran into
    Some challenges we ran into were learning React Native, extensions on VSCode, and Firebase authentication and database. Coming into this we were planning on building a web app, however our idea was more suited towards a mobile device so we took on the challenge. Some extensions on VSCode none of us have used before and learning how to operate LiveShare came as a bit of a hurdle. Lastly, using Firebase as our authenticator and database took some time because none of us had any experience with using Firebase in any aspect before.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
    Some accomplishments that we are proud of are being able to finish the project within 36 hours, developing a mobile app with no experience, and constructing a whole mobile application from the bottom up. Going into this hackathon we all had one goal in mind, come out of the hackathon with one finished product, and we hit that goal. Also, coming into this competition none of us have ever used React Native, so learning as we were coding was something we were proud of. Lastly, being able to come together as a group of randoms and cooperate smoothly is another aspect of this hackathon that we are proud of.

## What we learned
    Throughout this competition we learned the basics of React Native, how to integrate Firebase's authenticator and database, and how to layout a detailed plan and design for us to follow before we begin coding. Also, we learned the importance of time in comparison of the scope of the project. Overall, this whole hackathon was a good experience for each one of us because we were all able to use this competition as a learning experience.

## What's next for BuddyFinder
	The next step for BuddyFinder is to add more security to ensure that personal information, like name, location, and email, are not leaked. Add markers to look at the locations of 'Buddies' that you make on the app. Integrating Twilio integration to ensure that users will have someone to talk to at all times.
